# Holo YOLO

In this work, we propose an AR system for detecting early signs of dementia
by recognizing human-object interactions with the combination
of the HoloLens 2 and, an existing action estimation architecture
based on the simultaneous detection of the hands and the objects
in the current scene using YOLO.
